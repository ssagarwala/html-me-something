          I am a graduate of San Jose State University. San Jose State University is in San Jose, CA.  I did my Bachelor's in Computer
          Science back in 2005. After that I was working for some companies
           I also did some freelance work. I have learned alot
           of stuff on my own since I was making websites for clients. I learned alot of stuff on my own. Watching videos from youtube 
           I moved from California to St. Louis, MO.

          To me life in the midwest is very different than the life in the west. The life in the West coast is very fast
          as compared to the life over here. Especially the cooperate working environment is very different. When I started working, I was 
          surprised to find out that my manager usually would not come to office until 10 and then leave around 11:30 for lunch. 
          As compared to the west, escpecially California where managers usually sit till late.

            Now I want to get into the professional life again. I have taken some break to raise a family. My kids are alla in school and I
            want to get to the top of my professional life. I am certain that with all my hard work I will go to the top in software development.
            Alot of people have suggested to me that I switch my career and start some thing that would be easy for me. I don't think I can start 
            any thing new.
